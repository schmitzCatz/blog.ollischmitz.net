# Do you like writing tests?

Recently I was talking to a friend of mine and I showed him some source code I wrote he was interested in. After awhile he asked "Do you write unit tests?" shortly followed by answering his own question "I for my self do not like to write them, because they are tedious and I cannot see the benefit!". I was baffled, of cause I write tests! Not only do I find them helpful and necessary for almost anything but also I have a lot of fun writing tests. Time to explorer why we have so much of a different opinion on the topic.

## Why is testing tedious?
To explore that statement we have to have a look at what kind of tests my friend was referring to. He mainly works on Angular based web applications, I consider myself more as a backend guy. Surely I've written frontend in different kind of languages but I is not my kind of jazz. 

## Never saw a meaningful unit-test!

To give a bit of context, I f consider myself more like a backend guy.
