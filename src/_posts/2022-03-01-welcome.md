Hello Everybody, and thank you for reading this short introduction. 

During my day to day work I often encounter situations explaining best practices of software development and system architecture. 
Don't get me wrong, I like an open discussion and looking at a topic from different angles, I even like to be challenged on my own options. 
Unfortunately I have the feeling that some of this discussions are moving in circles and are repetitive. The root cause is that our industry is 
growing rapidly and experienced developers are a minority. 
Instead of repeating myself (and probably missing a topic ðŸ˜‰) I alway had the urge to write things down, at least for me. 

This blog is my contribution to the daily discussions of __Softwarecrafters__, __Softwaredevelopers__ and __Softwarearchitects__ 
with my intend to build a reference for further discussions.
Many thanks to my colleague at Grandcentrix [Marcus Held](https://www.code-held.com), who had this idea before me. Check out his excellent article about
[Microservices are a Big Ball of Mud](https://code-held.com/2022/07/28/microservices/) or [Prefer UUID for your Primary Key](https://code-held.com/2021/08/02/uuid-primary-key/).
