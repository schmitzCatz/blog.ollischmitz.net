<h1>Oliver Schmitz</h1>
<h2>Team Lead Backend Engineering</h2>
<p>
    My passion for software development started in young years with my first computer the good old C64. Writing and
    modifying my first programs at the age of 10 made me curious what else I can do.

    Today I'm Managing a Team of ten Highly trained and Motivated Software Engineers. We are developing Cloud Backend
    Solutions for [Grandcentrix](http://grandcentrx.net) with current technologies based on Kotlin and the Spring
    Framework. Formally working as a Software Architect for [Rola Security Solutions](https://www.rola.com/), I had the
    opportunity to work on a large scale framework and move it towards a distributed system for on premise installations
    for German and International Government Agencies.

    With 15 Years of experience developing software professionally for the JVM in different domains (Healthcare,
    eCommerce, Security Sector), I'm still passionate writing and talking about software.
